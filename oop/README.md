# while accessing class vairable in methods we can access by instance or class vaiable ,
# class vaiable is shared by all instance ,

when we try to access attrs on in instance , it will check in instance first , if not found then it will check in class ,
if not found then it will check in parent class ,

regular method takes instance as first argument ,
class method takes class as first argument ,
static method takes nothing as first argument ,
